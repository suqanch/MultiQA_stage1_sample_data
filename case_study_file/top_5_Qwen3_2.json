        "question": "How does ChuLo's chunk representation method address the limitations of existing approaches like truncation and sparse attention in handling long documents, and what evidence supports its effectiveness?",
        "evidence": "We propose ChuLo, a novel chunk representation method that enhances long document understanding by reducing input length while preserving semantic content. Unlike existing approaches like truncation and standard chunking, ChuLo minimizes information loss and maintains contextual dependencies.",

        "question": "How does the M-DocEval evaluation method assess the performance of models in generating interleaved summaries, and what metrics are used?",
        "evidence": "To provide a comprehensive and objective assessment of the performance in generating interleaved summaries, we design a multifaceted set of evaluation metrics. These metrics cover textual quality, image referencing appropriateness, and instruction-following capability, ensuring a holistic evaluation of the model abilities.",

        "question": "What are the key challenges faced by current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in document-level understanding, and how does Docopilot address these challenges?",
        "evidence": "Building upon this dataset, we developed a native baseline model for document-level multimodal understandingâ€“Docopilot. Unlike existing approaches that rely on RAG, our model achieves efficient document-level training and testing through simple engineering optimizations, such as multimodal data packing, Ring Attention, and Liger Kernel.",
